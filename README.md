# ðŸ“° Inshorts News API v2

---

#### This is the v2 for my previous Inshorts News API. You can check out the v1 [here.](https://github.com/sumitkolhe/inshorts-api)

---

### # So why a new version?

The v2 API comes with better fetching speeds, more accurate and ordered results, and a wider array of categories than the v1 API. The v2 API directly incorporates official Inshorts API underneath that provides all these benefits.

## :mag: Usage


### There are two ways to get news stories :



#### 1. Getting `All`, `Trending` or `Top` news stories :

**Base URL** : https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news/

You can use either of these endpoints : 

1. `all` 
2. `top` 
3. `trending`


Make a `GET`request to the **Base URL** to get the corresponding news in JSON format

```
https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news/{type}
```

**Example** - https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news/all


To limit the number of results per page, add `/{limit count}` at the end of the API url.

**Example** - https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news/all/23   this will limit the results to 23 for that page

> **NOTE :** If no limit is provided, default limit is 10 results per page
